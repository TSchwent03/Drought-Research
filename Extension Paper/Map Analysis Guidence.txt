1. What does this map show?

    Start with one or two sentences: “This map shows how often severe droughts have affected different parts of Missouri over the last 24 years.”
    Keep it simple and direct.

2. What are the main patterns?

    Describe what stands out: “You’ll notice that the Bootheel and northwest Missouri have had more frequent droughts, while central Missouri has seen fewer.”
    Use plain language and avoid numbers unless they’re easy to grasp.

3. Why does it look this way?

    Offer a simple explanation, if possible: “This could be because the Bootheel’s climate is drier and it relies more on rain for crops.”
    If the reason isn’t clear, it’s fine to say: “The reasons for these differences aren’t always obvious, but local climate and geography play a role.”

4. What does this mean for everyday life?

    Connect the data to real-world impacts: “Farmers in high-drought areas face bigger challenges, and communities may need to plan for water shortages more often.”
    Highlight anything that might surprise the reader: “It’s interesting to see that droughts often start in winter, not summer as many people expect.”

5. Wrap up or transition

    End with a takeaway: “Understanding these patterns helps all of us—especially those in hard-hit areas—prepare for dry times ahead.”
    Or, smoothly transition to the next section: “Next, we’ll look at how long droughts usually last in different regions.”
